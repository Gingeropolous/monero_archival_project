Odd bimodal distribution of lengths of side chains.

Lots that are ~1 deep (presumably natural)... Then a lot more that are longer (due to some second phenomenon)

In some cases, it seems that b0 blocks are received (duplicates) more often that b1 blocks. This might be anecdotal, and temporal analysis separating stats for b0 and b1 will answer for sure
